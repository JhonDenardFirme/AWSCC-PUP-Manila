## About
This project is a webpage for **AWS Cloud Club – PUP Manila**, designed to represent the organization and showcase its initiatives.

The webpage was built with **HTML and CSS only**, without external frameworks, to highlight clean structure and responsive design.

Some creative elements are derived from the **Creative’s Office Assets**. The **Mascots section** is a redesigned version inspired by the original AWSCC PUP website. However, the overall design concepts and implementation are original.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project folder. You can also visit the deployed Github Pages Website at 
2. Open the project in **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**.  
3. Use the **VSCode HTML Viewer** or the **Live Server extension** to preview the webpage in your browser.

## Assets
- All assets (images, icons, mascots, etc.) are already included in the project folder.  
- Fonts are loaded via **CDN**, so this project needs internet connection before loading in VSCode.

---

## Features
- Fully custom **HTML and CSS** implementation (no Bootstrap dependencies).  
- Responsive layout for banners, stats, and mascot sections.  
- Gradient text, smooth hover effects, and clipping masks for creative elements.  
- Minimalist navigation bar with mobile support.

## Notes
- Some assets were taken from official **Creative’s Office materials** for AWS Cloud Club.  
- The **Mascots section** is a redesigned interpretation, not a direct copy.  
- The design direction, layout, and interactions were built **originally** for this project.
